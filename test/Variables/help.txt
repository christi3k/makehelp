Usage: make [OPTION|GOAL|VARIABLE]...
Runs make to make the specified GOALs.
If no GOAL is specified, the default goal is made (usually "all").

Popular make OPTIONs:
  -s    Silent mode, disables command echo.
  -k    Keep going, continues after errors.
  -j N  Run N jobs in parallel.
  -n    Don't run the commands, just print them.
  -q    Run no commands; exit status says if up to date.
  -h    Print make help text.
Use option -h to lists the GNUmake part of the help.

A VARIABLE is specified as name=value pair.
Supported VARIABLEs:
  EXPORTED_CONDITIONAL_DEFINED
                    Exported conditional defined variable.
                    Current value: exported conditional defined
  EXPORTED_EXPANDED
                    Exported recursively expanded variable.
                    Current value: exported expanded
  EXPORTED_RECURSIVE_WITH_SPACES
                    Exported recursive variable defined with spaces
                    Current value: exported recursive with spaces
  EXPORTED_SIMPLE   Exported simple variable.
                    Current value: exported simple
  EXPORTED_SIMPLE_WITH_SPACES
                    Exported simple variable defined with spaces
                    Current value: exported simple with spaces
  UNEXPORTED_CONDITIONAL_DEFINED
                    Unexported conditional defined variable.
                    Current value: unexported conditional defined
  UNEXPORTED_EXPANDED
                    Unexported recursively expanded variable.
                    Current value: unexported expanded
  UNEXPORTED_RECURSIVE_WITH_SPACES
                    Unexported recursive variable defined with spaces
                    Current value: unexported recursive with spaces
  UNEXPORTED_SIMPLE
                    Unexported simple variable.
                    Current value: unexported simple
  UNEXPORTED_SIMPLE_WITH_SPACES
                    Unexported simple variable defined with spaces
                    Current value: unexported simple with spaces

Supported GOALs:
  help              Prints this help message.
  test              Runs this Makefile as a test.
                    This Makefile tests that all flavors of variables are properly expanded in the help text.
                    This requires that unexported variables are exported for the help: make goal.
